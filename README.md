# lexiconFALCON

This repository contains the codes for the *Lexicon-FALCON (LF)* algorithm proposed in 

Ampazis, N., and Sakketou, F. (2019) *A Constrained Optimization Algorithm for Learning GloVe Embeddings with Semantic Lexicons, Knowledge-based Systems (Under review)*

## Requirements

## Installation

Clone this repository in your home directory.

### Instructions to reproduce the results of the paper:
Due to GitHub's space restrictions, you need to download some additional files. Go to [lexiconFALCON/database/](https://github.com/flo3003/lexiconFALCON/tree/master/database) and [lexiconFALCON/input_files/](https://github.com/flo3003/lexiconFALCON/tree/master/input_files) and download the necessary files from the links provided.

Edit the `run_algos.sh` script to select the correct parameters and run
```
./run_algos.sh
```

### Instructions to create the input_files and database files:

Clone the following [Github repo](https://github.com/flo3003/glove-python) in your home directory and run
```
pip install glove_python
```

Go to the `glove-python` directory
```
cd ~/glove-python
```

and run
```
python setup.py cythonize
pip install -e .
```

Then run
```
ipython -i -- examples/get_database_files.py -c directory_to_corpus.txt -o ~/LexiconFALCON/lexicons/lexicon.txt -d 100
```

The following files will be constructed:
- `coo_matrix.csv` contains the co-occurrence matrix of `directory_to_corpus.txt` 
- `word_mapping.csv` contains the mapping of each **word** to an **Id**
- `lexicon.csv` contains the Ids of the words that are semantically related
- `corpus.model` and `glove.model` are the saved corpus and glove models
- `random_initial_vectors.txt` contains the embeddings' initialization 

The directory `~/LexiconFALCON/lexicons/` contains the lexicons that were used in the paper. 

If you need to construct only the `lexicon.csv` from the saved corpus and glove models run
```
ipython -i -- examples/get_database_files.py -l 1 -o ~/LexiconFALCON/lexicons/lexicon.txt -d 100
```
**Note that every time you run this command the `random_initial_vectors.txt` file will change.**

The argument `-d` refers to the embedding dimensions. The default is 100.

#### To start the training from random embeddings:

Copy the `random_initial_vectors.txt` in the `lexiconFALCON/input_files` directory by running:
```
cp ~/glove-python/random_initial_vectors.txt ~/lexiconFALCON/input_files
```

Go to the `lexiconFALCON` directory.
```
cd ~/lexiconFALCON
```

Create a directory `embeddings`
```
mkdir embeddings
```

Comment the lines `709-780` from `lexiconfalcon.c` and compile with
```
gcc -O3 lexiconfalcon.c -o lexiconfalcon -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lm
```

Edit the `run_algos.sh` script to select the correct parameters and run
```
./run_algos.sh
```

#### To start the training from pretrained embeddings:

Copy the `random_initial_vectors.txt` in the `lexiconFALCON/input_files` directory by running:
```
cp ~/glove-python/random_initial_vectors.txt ~/lexiconFALCON/input_files
```

Go to the `lexiconFALCON` directory.
```
cd ~/lexiconFALCON
```

Create a directory `embeddings`
```
mkdir embeddings
```

Download the pretrained embeddings in the `lexiconFALCON` directory. 

Run
```
./map_ids.sh  ~/lexiconFALCON/input_files pretrained_vectors.txt
```

This will create the following files:
- `pretrained_vectors_weights.txt` which contains only the words' vectors
- `mapped_ids.txt` which is the mapping file maps the indices of the vocabulary words to the indices of the corresponding words in the pretrained vector file. For example word "the" has index "3" in the vocabulary and index "56" in the pretrained vector file. The mapping file maps 3 to 56.

Edit lines `706` and `727` in `lexiconfalcon.c` to read the correct pretrained vector file and mapping file. Compile with
```
gcc -O3 lexiconfalcon.c -o lexiconfalcon -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lm
```

Edit the `run_algos.sh` script to select the desirable parameters and run
```
./run_algos.sh
```
# GloVe

This an implementation of the [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) algorithm in C.

### Instructions

Follow the same instructions with the lexiconFALCON algorithm.

Compile with 
```
gcc -O3 glove.c -o glove -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lm
```
